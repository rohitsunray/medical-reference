Store prescriptions and medical diagnostic information for the patients to refer when needed

The patient can upload prescriptions, reports, medical bills,etc

Should be able to browse by hospital, clinic, doctor, medicine name.

Store it for few years (how many years)?

Need a mobile application to upload the documents, practically.

Any competitor / open source application for more easy to use features.

Talk to Prashanth if he wants to use / promote the application to get started.
